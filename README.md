# Baking App
Baking app allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. The app allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

## Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are 
responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app.
Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things 
out for the Baking App.

## What I Learned

* Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage a third-party library in your app.
